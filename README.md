# Sample Superstore PowerBI Dashboard
I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully created 5 powerful dashboards for the Superstore data from 2014 to 2017. The dashboards are specifically designed to provide valuable insights about the overall functioning of the Superstore along with region-wise analysis of the sale, profit and cost of products in the entire US.

The process involved meticulous data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and the utilization of DAX language to create new measures, as well as merging different datasets. First step involved data cleaning and transformation where I removed all the null and [0] values from the Order ID to make the data more relevant.

## Dashboard contain:
 - Title
 - Score Card
 - Slicer
 - Line and Stacked Column Chart
 - Line and Clustered Column Chart
 - Donut Chart
 - Stacked Bar Chart
 - Gauge
 - Stacked Area Chart
